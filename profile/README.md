**[Holos] helps you manage your software development platform safely and easily.**

Engineering teams spend significant time creating custom scripts and error-prone templates to integrate software projects into a software development platform. This glue layer is often makeshift, slowing teams down and increasing the risk of outages.

Holos helps teams deliver value faster by offering a well defined, safe, and automated integration layer to manage your platform holistically.
